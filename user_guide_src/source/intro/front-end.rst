The front-end is a Single Page Application (SPA) created using the commercial 
JavaScript framework Sencha Ext JS. Due to licensning restrictions only a compiled 
production build is included in this project. The source files for the SPA are included, 
but to actually build the project a license of Sencha Ext JS is required.

The SPA contains simple functions to manage the Queens and Hives defined in the system. 
Editing, creating and deleting is done through the lists.  Each Queen can be connected to one 
Hive. To keep track of lineage another Queen can also be set as the anscestor to a Queen. 

Functions to log Inspections and Harvests are available to complete this demonstration project.
