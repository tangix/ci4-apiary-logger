Welcome to Apiary Logger
#########################

Apiary Logger is a sample project demonstrating how an Ext JS front-end can be connected 
using a RESTful API to CodeIgniter4 back-end.

The purpose of this project is to experiment with a front/back-end system communicating using 
RESTful commands. To have something to work with, an imaginary apiary logging system is implemented.

The Apiary Logger is a tool to keep track of your honey bees in the Apiary. Bees live in **Hives** 
in societies with the **Queen** as the sole leader of the Hive. There is only one Queen in each Hive 
ruling over the thousands of **Worker Bees**. The Queen normally only leaves the Hive once and that 
is when to mate. After mating the Queen returns and if the beekeeper is tending to the Hive in a good 
manner, the Queen will live for about 5 years. A well-functioning Queen will lay about 1000 eggs/day 
during summer season and make sure the Hive is of good strength with many bees.

The Queen directs the Worker Bees to their duties. The Worker Bees are performing the actual work in 
the Hive, for example nursing larveas, cleaning and collecting Nectar and Pollen to produce Honey. 
All Worker Bees are female and typically live for 30-45 days before the die.

In the beginning of the season **Drones** (male bees) are allowed to live in the Hive. The Drones 
only consume honey while waiting for a fertile Queen to pass by the Hive. When this happens all Drones 
leave the Hive and tries to mate with the passing Queen. In the fall when the Hive prepares for winter,
all Drones are killed or evicted from the Hive by the Worker Bees. The Drones have no purpose during the 
winter and will on consume the precious honey that should last throughout the winter.
